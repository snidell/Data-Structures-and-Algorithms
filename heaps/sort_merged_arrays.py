# 10.1 MERGE SORTED FILES
# This problem is motivated by the following scenario. You are given 500 files, e
# ach containing stock trade information for an S&P 500 company. Each trade is
# encoded by a line in the following format: 1232111,AAPL,3Â©,456.12.
# Write a program that takes as input a set of sorted sequences and computes
# the union of these sequences as a sorted sequence. For example, if the input is
# (3, 5, 7), (0, 6), and (0, 6, 28), then the output is (0, 0,3, 5, 6, 6, 7, 28).

    # Let le be the number of input sequences. Then there are no more than k
    # elements in the min-heap. Both extract-min and insert take O(log k) time.
    # Hence, we can do the merge in O(n logic) time. The space complexity
    # is O(k) beyond the space needed to write the final result. In particular,
    # if the data comes from files and is written to a file, instead of arrays,
    # we would need only O(k) additional storage.
